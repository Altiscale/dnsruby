Dnsruby
=======

Dnsruby is a pure Ruby DNS implementation. It aims to comply
with all DNS RFCs, including DNSSEC NSEC3 support.

Dnsruby presents a new API for DNS. It is based on Ruby's core
resolv.rb Resolv API, but has been much extended to provide a
complete DNS implementation.

Dnsruby runs a single I/O thread to handle all concurrent
queries. It is also able to use EventMachine if it is installed.
It is therefore suitable for high volume DNS applications.

The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of features :

o Implemented RRs :  A, AAAA, AFSDB, ANY, CERT, CNAME, DNAME,
     HINFO, ISDN, LOC, MB, MG, MINFO, MR, MX, NAPTR, NS, NSAP,
     OPT, PTR, PX, RP, RT, SOA, SPF, SRV, TKEY, TKEY, TSIG,
     TSIG,TXT, WKS, X25

o Generic RR types supported (RFC3597)

o Zone transfer (AXFR and IXFR) supported

o Dyamic updates supported

o DNSSEC support in progress
